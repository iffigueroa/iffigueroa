## Hey I'm Francesca 👋 🤠! 

💻 I'm a developer, engineer, space enthusiast, and data nerd. 

🦬 I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science a few years back.

🚀 I got my start at an aerospace startup where I developed CubeSat payload software, implemented on-orbit image processing algorithms, and built scientific modeling software.

👩‍⚕️ After that, I worked at a healthtech startup and focused on creating RPA to automate the medical billing process.

👩‍🎓 Now, I'm taking some time to finish my Masters in Data Science! 

🌱 I love working in Python, C/C++, R, and Java am working on leveling up my web dev skills when I'm not studying.
